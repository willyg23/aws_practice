# aws_practice
See the project in action here (add video link)

I used this project to practice my AWS skills regarding: Networking, APIs, Availability, Scalability, and Load Balancing.
<br>
The aws architecture was initially created to use EC2, load balancing, and auto-scaling (instead of lambda), and that initial version of the project can be seen in this ![commit](https://github.com/willyg23/aws_practice/tree/0b378fe346bea511106ac5d708a35b9d16e65bdc)
<br>
The project was also used as part of my senior design project, which my team won an award for (out of how many teams, + link)

( we only used 1 database, because multi-az databases are not in the AWS free tier :( )
